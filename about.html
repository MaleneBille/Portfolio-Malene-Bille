        <p>I originally graduated from CBS with a bachelor in Communication and french translation, since both language, culture and communication has always been an area of great interest for me.
          After graduation and after working some time in the "real world", I found out that I there was a part of the field in communication that I hadn't explored yet - web communication.
          I've been schooled for the written and oral part of web communication but not the designing part. Since I love to be creative by e.g drawing, it was obvious to me that I had to explore this part of the web too. </p>
