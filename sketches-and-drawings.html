        <p>I recently had a wow experience when I first started working with photoshop. I have always loved to draw but the colors I could make with pencil and promarkers didn't pop out the way I wanted them too. Soon I realised that I can actually take a hand drawn/colored sketch and edit it in photoshop and get the color result I want. In the process of learning to photoshop images, I also learned to outline drawings and now I can fill in colors and shadows in photoshop without being distracted by the colors I did by hand. 
          Below are some examples of my first discovery with photoshop. </p>
        <h3>#1 Birdie</h3>

        <p> A simple bird that I've sketched. </p>
        <img src="images/fugl-fritlagt.png" alt="">
        <p> The same bird - now photoshopped. </p>
        <h3>#2 Little Red Riding Hood</h3>
        <img src="images/japanese-girl-enhanced-right.png" alt="">
        <p> Hand drawn with pencil
          and promarkers. </p>
        <h3>#3 Batcat</h3>

        <p> Hand drawn with pencil
          and promarkers. </p>
